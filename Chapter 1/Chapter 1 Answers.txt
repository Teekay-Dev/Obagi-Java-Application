1.7 Java Compilation Phases
i)Compilation Phase – The Java compiler (javac) translates the .java source file into a .class file containing bytecode.
ii)Execution Phase – The JVM takes the .class file, verifies the bytecode, and interprets or compiles it into native machine code for execution.

1.8 Object-Oriented Concepts Applied to a Wristwatch
Object: A wristwatch is an object as it has a state and behavior.
Attributes: Attributes include time, date, color, size, and material.
Behaviors: Setting the time, showing the current time, switching modes, and activating the alarm.
Class: A blueprint for different types of watches.
Inheritance: An alarm clock is a subclass of a regular wristwatch with added functionality.
Modeling: Using diagrams and structures to represent the watch's functionality.
Messages: A user interacts with the watch by pressing buttons, sending messages to change settings.
Encapsulation: Internal mechanisms (like time tracking) are hidden from the user.
Interface: The watch face provides an interface for displaying time and interacting with buttons.
Information Hiding: Internal working of how the watch keeps time is hidden from the user.

1.9 Carbon Footprint Calculator

1.10 Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator
Visit BMI Calculator.
BMI Formula:
                                   BMI = weight in kg/(height in meters)^2

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5–24.9
Overweight: 25–29.9
Obese: BMI ≥ 30
